# MCP Tool for Generating Presentations  
### Making monthly Parent-Tutor meeting slides without losing my sanity  
<hr />  
<br />  

Every month, as part of my tutoring gig, I prepare **Parent-Tutor Meeting (PTM)** presentations — one per student. Each covers progress, diagnostic/test scores, practice data, learning gaps, and next steps.  

Sounds fine in theory. But in practice? *Absolute chaos.*  
<br />  
The process used to be: copy scores from IXL → paste into slides → fix formatting mess → write notes → re-align text boxes → add action plans… and repeat this for *every* student.  
<br />  
By the end, I was drowning in typo corrections and juggling too many tabs.  
<br />  
So, I built myself a little escape hatch:  
**an MCP tool that generates these PPTs in seconds.**  

<br />  

I wanted a way to:
- Paste raw diagnostic/IXL data without worrying about formatting  
- Write notes freely (no structure, no stress)  
- Let Claude clean it all up and fill placeholders in the PPT  
<br />  
Now I just run the tool, give it messy student data, and boom - a ready to present deck lands in my `generated_ppts` folder.  
<br />  
So glad MCP tools are a thing.
